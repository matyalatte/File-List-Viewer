# Getting Started

## 1. File Format

Input file should be a list of paths.  
And each line should have a file path like this.  

```
noneed/foo/bar.png
noneed/foo/hello.txt
wantit/test/this.txt
wantit/that.jpg
what
```

## 2. Open file list

Run exe and drop a file onto the window.  
It will read the file list.

## 3. Check files

Check file paths you want to export.  
You can double-click files to check them.  
You can also right-click a folder and select `Check All` to check all files in the folder.

> If a check mark is on a folder, it means all files in the folder are checked.  

## 4. Dump paths

Save the selected paths. (`Menu->Save`)  
You can get a new txt file like this.  

```
wantit/test/this.txt
wantit/that.jpg
```
